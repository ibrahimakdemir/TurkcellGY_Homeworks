# Divine Ascension - An OOP Console Game

> **⚠️ This project is currently in the planning stage and has not yet been developed. The storyline and game concept have been determined, but the game itself is not yet playable. I will update this Readme file as progress is made on the project.**
> 
## 🔎Overview

This project was developed with the aim of reinforcing my knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts in C#. Through the development of the Divine Ascension game, I was able to implement several core OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction, which I learned from the OOP topics taught by our instructor [Türkay Ürkmez](https://github.com/turkayurkmez) during the TurkcellGY training camp.

Divine Ascension is a turn-based console game developed using object-oriented programming concepts in C#. The game features characters with different weapons, each with unique damage and accuracy ratings, as well as a currency system that allows players to purchase new weapons. The game takes place in an ancient world where players embark on a quest to reach the peak of Mount Olympus and obtain the power of the gods.

>***I also utilized [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to assist with the development of Divine Ascension. ChatGPT provided valuable assistance in generating ideas, providing suggestions for game mechanics, and helping with debugging. Its natural language processing capabilities were especially useful in creating engaging dialogues and immersive gameplay. I am grateful for the contributions of ChatGPT to the project.***

## 📜Storyline

In the ancient world, rumors have been spreading about a mysterious power at the peak of Mount Olympus that can grant unimaginable strength to those who possess it. You, as the player, are a warrior on a quest to reach the top of the mountain and obtain this power. However, the journey will not be easy, as the mountain is home to all manner of dangerous creatures and obstacles.

To aid you in your journey, you have a variety of weapons at your disposal, each with its own damage and accuracy ratings. You can also purchase new weapons with the currency you collect throughout the game. The ultimate goal is to reach the peak of Mount Olympus and obtain the power of the gods, which will grant you divine strength and make you an unstoppable force.

## 💡OOP Concepts Used

Divine Ascension was developed using several core OOP concepts, including:

* Inheritance: Characters and weapons are created using inheritance to reuse code and simplify the design.
* Encapsulation: Character properties such as health and damage are encapsulated to ensure that they are only modified through appropriate methods.
* Polymorphism: Different weapons have different behaviors, allowing for polymorphism during gameplay.
* Abstraction: The game is designed to hide complex details from the user and focus on the high-level game mechanics, using abstraction to simplify the code.

## 💻Code Structure

The game is built using a modular design to separate different game elements such as characters, weapons, and game mechanics. Each module is designed to be as independent as possible to make the code more readable and easier to maintain.

## ✒️Conclusion

Divine Ascension is a fun and challenging game that uses OOP concepts to deliver an immersive gaming experience. By using inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction, the game is designed to be modular, efficient, and easy to maintain.
